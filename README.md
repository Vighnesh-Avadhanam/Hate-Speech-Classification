* Find Dataset to train, ideal if hate is labeled
* Test with "ambiguous data," (Twitter, Reddit, Craigslist, Quora)
* Each comes up with a model to use
    - Nick: Logistsic
    - Ben: Naive Baye's
    - Juan: XGBoost
    - Chris: Random Forest
    - Vighnesh: KNN
    - Misc.: Ridge, Lasso
    - Batch Gradient Descent: Randomly take batch (subset of row) and compute gradient on subset of data
